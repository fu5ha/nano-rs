Nano-rs is a pure Rust implementation of the Nano cryptocurrency based on Tokio. It is currently in its very infancy.

This repo serves as a monorepo that contains several crates, including the root `nano-rs` crate, which is the node implementation itself. There are also several subcrates:

- `nanopow-rs` is a standalone Proof of Work implementation.
- `nano-lib-rs` provides types and functions for working with the Nano protocol in Rust.
